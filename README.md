There are 3 different states for git
Everything that we are working on is in the Working Directory. This is where all the code and directories that weâ€™re creating live all the time
The Staging Area is where we explicitly add files. Limbo
The actual .git directory is the Git Repository where the files are committed; where our snapshots are stored
